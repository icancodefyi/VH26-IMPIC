 * The plus icon in the composer no longer opens the PDF picker (that stays
 * in the sidebar) -- it now asks for a PHOTO of a machine's display, the way
 * a technician would point a phone at an HMI showing a fault. There is no
 * real vision model behind it and none is planned for this pass: the photo
 * is only ever shown back in the chat bubble, never sent anywhere. Whatever
 * is typed into `mock_reply` below is what appears as the "answer" every
 * time a photo is attached, rendered through the exact same card as a real
 * cited answer so it demos convincingly.
 *
 * To point this at your own demo image: replace the fields below with
 * whatever that image actually shows. Everything here is plain data, in the
 * same shape a real answer already comes back in --
 *   - `error_code`   the code visible on the screen (omit if there isn't one)
 *   - `meaning`      one sentence: what that code means
 *   - `probable_causes` short bullet list
 *   - `corrective_action` numbered steps, in the order to try them
 *   - `citations`    leave EMPTY unless you know the exact document_id/page
 *                     of something actually loaded right now -- a citation
 *                     pointing at nothing real will 404 when clicked
 *   - `confidence`   "high" | "medium" | "low"
 *
 * This is independent of the page's language switcher on purpose: it is one
 * canned example you control directly, not machine-translated three ways.
